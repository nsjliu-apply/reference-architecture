# Search Engine Optimzation (SEO) testing

## Why

We want our applications to get a good page ranking, when queried by search engine providers.

## What

By applying SEO testing assertions during our [end to end](e2e.md) tests, we can ensure that our applications have the best possible page ranking.

## How

Current standards that are tested for:

- Only one H1 tag per page
- Images have alt text
- Title length less than 65 chars
- Meta description exists and is less than 155 characters
